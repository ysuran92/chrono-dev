Fictional portfolio page using fullpage.js.

The objective of this project is to showcase and better my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is very basic but it has nonetheless helped me gain an increased understanding of the aforementioned languages.

It revolves around an idea a friend and I had of working together to build software related to gaming, but not limited to it.

The portfolio remains fictional, though not a hundred percent, specially regarding our skills, studies, and social media links.
